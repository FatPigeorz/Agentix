"""`Namespace` marker + method discovery for closure stub classes.

A closure declares its public API as a `Namespace` subclass with
`...`-bodied methods (the stub). The impl is a **separate, unrelated
class** whose methods structurally match the stub. `_register.py`
glues them together via `Dispatcher.bind_namespace(StubCls, impl_instance)`.
See CLAUDE.md for the framework principle this enforces.

```python
# __init__.py — what callers import
from agentix.namespace import Namespace

class Bash(Namespace):
    async def run(self, command: str) -> BashResult: ...

# _impl.py — what only the sandbox imports. No inheritance from Bash.
class BashImpl:
    async def run(self, command: str) -> BashResult:
        ...

# _register.py — composes stub + impl
from agentix.dispatch import Dispatcher
from . import Bash
from ._impl import BashImpl

def register() -> Dispatcher:
    return Dispatcher.bind_namespace(Bash, BashImpl())
```

`Namespace` is declared as an empty `Protocol`, so a closure author who
wants pyright to structurally verify their impl can declare the stub
as a Protocol too:

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable

@runtime_checkable
class Bash(Namespace, Protocol):
    async def run(self, command: str) -> BashResult: ...

# In _register.py — pyright would catch a structural mismatch here.
impl: Bash = BashImpl()
return Dispatcher.bind_namespace(Bash, impl)
```

This is opt-in. The plain `class Bash(Namespace)` form works too — the
framework discovers methods structurally and the runtime check at CI
(`tools/check_stub_impl.py`) catches signature drift regardless.

@runtime_checkable
class Namespace(Protocol):
    """Marker Protocol for a closure's typed surface.

    Declaring this as a Protocol means subclasses can opt into Protocol
    semantics by adding `Protocol` to their own base list:

        class Bash(Namespace, Protocol):
            ...

    A plain `class Bash(Namespace)` is a nominal class that structurally
    satisfies `Namespace` trivially (empty interface). Either form works
    with `Dispatcher.bind_namespace`.
