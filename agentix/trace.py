"""Trace emission with fan-out sinks.

Closure impls call `agentix.trace.emit(kind, payload)` to record one
event in the rollout's trace. Every registered **trace sink** receives
the event. The framework's runtime ships a sink that fans events out
over the Socket.IO `trace` channel; downstream observability sinks
(Sentry, OTel, Logfire, …) can register their own.

Sink registration uses the `agentix.trace_sink` entry-point group.
Each entry points at a `module:install` callable that the framework
invokes once at startup. The callable receives a *registrar* it can
call with its own sink function:

```python
# downstream agentix-trace-otel/agentix_trace_otel/__init__.py
from agentix.trace import register_sink

def install():
    def _sink(kind, payload, call_id, source):
        # emit OTel span / send to collector / etc.
        ...
    register_sink(_sink)
```

```toml
# downstream pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."agentix.trace_sink"]
otel = "agentix_trace_otel:install"
```

Then `pip install agentix-trace-otel` is the entire wiring — the
runtime imports + calls `install()` at lifespan-startup and the sink
gets every event after that.

`call_id` correlates events to a specific rollout. The dispatcher pins
the active call_id into a contextvar before invoking each impl, so
`emit()` picks it up automatically — namespaces don't have to thread it
through their code.
