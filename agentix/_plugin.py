"""Generic plugin registry — one tool, all extension axes.

Every framework axis (`Deployment`, trace sinks, spec resolvers, CLI
subcommands, wire patterns, the namespace surface itself) is a thin
wrapper around `Registry[T]`. The registry knows two ways to find
plugins:

  * **Production:** `importlib.metadata.entry_points(group=...)` — what
    `pip install some-plugin` populates. The dist's `pyproject.toml`
    declares its entries; nothing in the framework changes when a new
    plugin is installed.
  * **Testing / dynamic:** the in-process `register(name, factory)`
    method. Convenient for unit tests, fixtures, or programmatic
    composition; not part of the documented user-facing surface.

Lookup is lazy — entry points are walked on the first `get()` /
`all()` call. Loaders that raise are caught and remembered per-entry
(`errors()`), so one broken plugin doesn't poison the rest.

How each axis *uses* a Registry depends on its semantic shape:

  * **select-one** (Deployment): `registry.get(name)`
  * **fan-out** (trace sinks): `registry.all().values()`
  * **chain-of-responsibility** (spec resolvers): sorted by `priority`
  * **merge-namespace** (CLI subcommands): `registry.all().items()`

The registry just gives you the `name → T` mapping; the consumer
decides the semantics.
