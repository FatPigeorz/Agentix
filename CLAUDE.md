# Project Conventions

## Two Concepts

Agentix has exactly two ideas:

1. **Remote calls** — `c.remote(fn, *args, **kwargs)` calls an
   importable Python function inside a sandbox worker. The target is
   `fn.__module__ + "::" + fn.__qualname__`; args/kwargs travel as a
   single pickle blob and the return value is unpickled host-side.
2. **Bundle** — `agentix build [path]` packages a Python project and
   its declared dependencies into a deploy-ready Docker image. The
   project's `[project].dependencies` defines what modules are
   installed into the runtime venv.

The primary user model is:

```python
from app import run

result = await client.remote(run, input="hello")
```

`import app; await client.remote(app.run, ...)` also works because it
passes the same function object.

## Three Built-In Systems

agentix-core ships **three** independent systems, mapped to three
reserved Socket.IO namespaces:

| Namespace | System  | Public API                                      |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/`       | RPC     | `client.remote(fn, ...)`                        |
| `/trace`  | tracing | `agentix.trace.span(...)` / `trace.Processor`    |
| `/log`    | logging | stdlib `logging` (auto-bridged sandbox → host) |

Plugins (`abridge`, future LLM tools, ...) MUST live on their own
namespace `/<package-name>`. Two plugins can never collide because
PyPI package names are globally unique.

## Composition Over Inheritance

Use inheritance only for genuine lifecycle interfaces:
- `Deployment` Protocol for deployment backends
- `agentix.Namespace` / `agentix.AsyncClientNamespace` for plugin SIO
  handlers (mirrors `socketio.AsyncClientNamespace`)
- `trace.Processor` for trace sinks

Everywhere else, prefer normal functions, Protocols, composition
objects, or callbacks. A remote target is just a Python callable
serialized by stdlib pickle — there is no base class for user code to
inherit from.

## No Backward Compatibility Shims

This repo is in active design. Breaking changes are fine.

- Rename by deleting the old name, not by accepting both.
- Do not add deprecation warnings.
- Do not leave comments explaining removed behavior.
- Update tests to the current shape; do not preserve tests for removed
  behavior.

Sibling repos (`Agentix-Runtime-Basic`, `Agentix-Deployment-*`,
`abridge`, `agentix-cookbook`) are updated in lockstep with HEAD.

## Systems Map

```text
agentix/
├── sio.py             — agentix.Namespace + register_namespace (sandbox side)
├── log/               — stdlib logging Handler bridge (sandbox → host)
├── trace/             — Trace + Span + SpanEvent + Processor
├── runtime/
│   ├── shared/        — wire types, codec, framing
│   ├── client/        — RuntimeClient (host) + AsyncClientNamespace
│   └── server/        — FastAPI + Socket.IO + worker subprocess
├── deployment/        — Deployment Protocol + backend plugin loader
├── cli/               — `agentix build`
└── nix/               — shipped Nix builder (flake + uv2nix wrapper)
```

One line per system:

- **sio** — generic pipe-bridged Namespace API. Sandbox plugins
  subclass `agentix.Namespace`; host plugins subclass
  `agentix.AsyncClientNamespace`. Runtime knows zero plugin event names.
- **log** — installs a `logging.Handler` on the worker's root logger;
  every `LogRecord` ships over `/log` and replays on the host's logging
  tree. Zero new API — users write `logger.info(...)` normally.
- **trace** — OTel-style `Trace` + `Span` + `SpanEvent` + `Processor`.
  Worker-side `Processor` ships span lifecycle as events on `/trace`;
  host-side `RuntimeClient` auto-registers a consumer.
- **runtime.shared** — msgpack codec, length-prefixed worker frames,
  pydantic wire models, branded wire ids.
- **runtime.client** — `RuntimeClient.remote(fn, ...)` over Socket.IO
  `/`. `register_namespace(ns)` attaches plugin handlers.
- **runtime.server** — `agentix-server`; owns one worker subprocess,
  invokes pickle-resolved callables, dynamic namespace forwarding for
  `/trace`, `/log`, and any plugin `/<package-name>`.
- **deployment** — host-side `Deployment` Protocol and backend lookup.
- **cli** — `agentix build [path]`.
- **nix** — `flake.nix`, `builder.nix`, `wrapper.nix.tmpl` shipped as
  wheel data; `agentix build` stages them per invocation.

## Remote Call Implementation

`c.remote(fn, ...)` serializes `fn` with stdlib pickle (wrapped in a
base64-encoded `RemoteCallable` str). args + kwargs travel as a single
pickle blob.

```python
# my_project/tasks.py
async def run(seed: int) -> dict:
    ...

# caller
from my_project.tasks import run

result = await client.remote(run, seed=42)
```

Sync functions work too; the invoker awaits only when the result is
awaitable. Only the unary call shape is supported — for streaming /
bidirectional needs, build it on top of the generic `agentix.sio`
namespace API.

## Plugin Extension via Namespaces

Plugins (e.g. `abridge`) define **two** classes, one per side:

```python
# Sandbox side (runs in the worker subprocess)
import agentix

class MyService(agentix.Namespace):
    namespace = "/my-plugin"

    async def on_request(self, payload):
        # `payload` is whatever the host emitted — auto-unpacked
        result = await do_work(payload)
        await self.emit("request:result", result)

agentix.register_namespace(MyService())

# Host side
class MyHost(agentix.AsyncClientNamespace):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("/my-plugin")

    async def on_request_result(self, data):
        # data is a plain dict — agentix auto-unpacks msgpack
        ...

client = RuntimeClient(url)
client.register_namespace(MyHost())
async with client as c:
    ...
```

Round-trip helper: `await self.request("op", body)` from sandbox auto-
correlates with the host's `op:result` / `op:error` reply event using
a generated `request_id`.

## Bundle Implementation

`agentix build [path]` produces a self-contained, distro-portable
runtime image from one project root. No base image, no `FROM`, no `pip
install` inside the build. Everything goes through Nix:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-agent"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "agentixx>=0.2.1",
    "agentix-runtime-basic>=0.1.2",
    "agentix-deployment-docker>=0.1.3",
]
```

The user must also have a `uv.lock` (run `uv lock`). uv2nix consumes
that lock and produces Nix derivations for every Python dep — the
interpreter, agentixx, plugins, the user's project, and transitive
deps all land in `/nix/store/...` with rpath-resolved closures, so the
resulting image runs against any Linux task image when overlaid via
`SandboxConfig.runtime_image`.

Two inputs to the build:

1. **Python side — `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`.** uv2nix reads the
   lock; `mkVirtualEnv` materializes a venv with the full closure;
   `/bin/agentix-server` becomes the entry point.

2. **System side — plugin `default.nix` files.** Each plugin may ship
   a `default.nix` next to its Python module. `agentix build`
   discovers them via `importlib.resources.files('agentix.<short>') /
   'default.nix'` and `symlinkJoin`s the results into the bundle's
   `/bin/`. Plugins that need no system binaries can skip the file.

Plugin nix expressions follow one convention: `{ pkgs }: drv`. The
builder hands every plugin the same Nixpkgs revision (pinned in
`agentix/nix/flake.lock`).

The two-image runtime: deployments overlay `SandboxConfig.runtime_image`
(the bundle from `agentix build`) onto `SandboxConfig.image` (a
task-specific base) via Docker 25's `--mount type=image,source=…,
target=/nix,subpath=nix,readonly`. No rebuild needed when the agent
moves between task images.

## Wire Protocol

RPC on `/`:

```text
call         {call_id, callable, arguments}
call:result  {call_id, value}    # value is pickle bytes
call:error   {call_id, error}
cancel       {call_id}
```

Plugin namespaces are opaque to the runtime — events and payload
shapes are extension-chosen. The pipe carries `sio_open` (worker
declares a namespace), `sio_emit` (worker → server → broadcast), and
`sio_inbound` (server → worker, forwarded from a host emit).

Errors stay in-band: Socket.IO emits an error event for RPC; plugin
namespaces follow whatever convention the plugin picks (typically
`event:error` with a matching `request_id`).

## Project Management — uv

This project uses **uv** for everything dependency-related:

- Install / sync: `uv sync` (no `pip install`)
- Add a dep: `uv add <pkg>` (writes `pyproject.toml` + locks)
- Add a dev dep: `uv add --dev <pkg>` (goes to `[dependency-groups]`)
- Ad-hoc install into the venv without touching pyproject: `uv pip install`
- Run a tool from the venv: `uv run <cmd>` or `.venv/bin/<cmd>`
- Build wheels/sdists: `uv build`
- Publish: `uv publish` (only when releasing — see below)

Never invoke `pip` directly; `pip install` bypasses the lockfile and
mixes dependency management styles. When you need a runtime dep, the
right answer is `uv add`. When you need a tool just for the current
venv, `uv pip install`.

## Typing — No Bypass

CI runs `pyright agentix` and **must** stay at zero errors. If pyright
flags something, **fix the root cause**, do not `# type: ignore`. Common
patterns that lead to ignore-spam and what to do instead:

- **Stubs lie about a decorator's return.** Call the function
  non-decorator style: `obj.on(name, handler)` instead of
  `@obj.on(name)`. The body of `handler` is still type-checked, and the
  registration side-effect happens just the same.
- **`getattr(self, name)` returns `object`.** Either don't go through
  `getattr` (walk the class via `inspect.getmembers` or `__dict__`),
  or relax the declared type to honestly reflect what could come back.
  A `Handler = Callable[[Any], Any]` is more accurate than
  `Callable[[Any], Awaitable[None] | None]` if the function in fact
  accepts any return type.
- **`Protocol` mismatch after refactor.** Update the Protocol; do not
  ignore-suppress at the assignment site.

`type: ignore` is allowed only when the lie is in a *third-party*
type stub that you cannot fix — and even then, prefer pinning the
narrowest comment (`# type: ignore[specific-rule]`) and noting why.

## Development Distribution

We do NOT publish to PyPI during active development. Sibling repos
install each other via `[tool.uv.sources]` git URLs so HEAD changes
propagate without a release cycle:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "agentixx",
    "abridge",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
agentixx = { git = "https://github.com/Agentiix/Agentix.git" }
abridge  = { git = "https://github.com/Agentiix/abridge.git" }
```

When (rarely) a real release is cut, drop the matching `tool.uv.sources`
entry so the resolver picks up the PyPI version.
