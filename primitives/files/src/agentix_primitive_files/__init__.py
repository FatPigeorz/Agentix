"""Files primitive — sandbox file upload / download as an Agentix closure.

Stub-only module. Callers import the typed `Files` Namespace; the impl
lives in `_impl.py` and runs only inside the sandbox. The framework
composes stub + impl automatically.

Usage:

    from agentix import RuntimeClient
    from agentix_primitive_files import Files

    async with RuntimeClient(sandbox.runtime_url) as c:
        r = await c.remote(Files.upload, path="/workspace/input.txt", content=b"hello")
        print(r.size)

        data = await c.remote(Files.download, path="/workspace/output.txt")

Files are encoded as pydantic `bytes` (base64 in the JSON wire form).
Suitable for kB–MB sized files; very large blobs should ship via a
purpose-built binary `WirePattern` rather than the unary JSON path.
